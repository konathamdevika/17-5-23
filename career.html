		<h3>Kim’s journey began when he and his current band mate Jimin made a remix of ‘Old School Love ft. Ed Sheeran’ and uploaded it on Soundcloud, to celebrate their graduation. He went on to join Bangtan Boys in 2011, but wasn’t revealed to be an official member of the band until 2013. He co-wrote and co-produced songs such as ‘Hold Me Tight’ and co-composed ‘Fun Boyz’. His melody, combined with Jungkook’s original lyrics, placed their song ‘Stigma’ on the 26th position on the Gaon Music Chart and 10th on the Billboard World Digital Singles Chart. Kim is well-known for his cover of ‘Someone Like You’ by Adele, which gained him a lot of popularity. His band BTS has won multiple Melon Music Awards, Gaon Chart K-pop Awards, Golden Disk Awards and the Seoul Music Awards. In 2016, V entered into yet another field of the entertainment industry, which is acting. He made his debut in KBS2’s historical drama, ‘Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth’. He was also responsible for the popular soundtrack from the movie.

Kim Taehyung is one of those people who come out of nowhere, only to take the internet by storm, almost overnight. Not only is he an incredible vocalist, songwriter, and keyboardist, he is also a budding actor. Being his multi-talented self, he shows the prospect of a bright future. Besides being so skilled, he is also the face of his band, and is easily considered one of the most popular K-pop artists of all time.V is a South Korean singer, songwriter, and actor who has a net worth of $20 million. He is best known for being a singer in the South Korean boy band BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys.

In 2019 the group generated $170 million touring. The only group to earn more was Metallica. Thanks largely to these touring revenues, between June 2019 and June 2020, the BTS members earned a combined $50 million, roughly $7 million per member.

On September 28, 2020, BTS' management company Big Hit Entertainment went public a South Korean stock exchange. The company ended its first day of trading with a market cap of $4.1 billion. It was the third-largest South Korean stock market debut in three years. As owner of 43% of the company, Big Hit founder Bang Si-Hyuk ended the IPO day with a net worth of $1.4 million. A month before the public offering Bang gave each member of the group 68,385 shares in the company ahead of its IPO. At the end of the company's first day of trading each of the seven members found themselves sitting on stakes worth $7.9 million.

UPDATE (March 15, 2023): After months of speculation, BTS member V is finally confirmed as brand ambassador for Hedi Slimane‘s CELINE.

The K-pop star graced the April cover of Elle Korea, which noted that he is the newest “CELINE boy.” Kicking off his partnership with the fashion label, the musician appeared on three different covers for the magazine.<br/>
ORIGINAL STORY (January 29, 2023): Following in the footsteps of his bandmates, V is reportedly the latest BTS member to sign a deal with a luxury brand.

The 27-year-old, real name Kim Tae-hyung, seems to have partnered with CELINE as the label’s newest brand ambassador, joining BLACKPINK’s Lisa and South Korean actor Park Bo-gum. The three stars previously attended Hedi Slimane’s Summer 2023 menswear show together, creating a viral moment on social media.

While the news isn’t official as of writing, Les Echos — a French media outlet owned by CELINE’s parent company LVMH — reported on the influence of K-pop in fashion in an article about Paris Fashion Week Men’s. In addition to mentioning Jimin, who was recently named global brand ambassador for Dior, the article notes that V just signed a deal with CELINE.

With BTS’ collective brand deal with Louis Vuitton expired, fashion houses have been rushing to partner with the group’s members over the past month. In mid-January, Jimin was chosen as Dior’s ambassador, shortly followed by Suga for Valentino.
